# Overview



This is a basic Sudoku Game, I am developing it to get used to Arcade and practice my python language, The Rules of Sudoku are quite simple:
Goal: Fill the grid so each row, column, and 3x3 box contains digits 1-9 without repeating.

Click a cell to select it, then press a number key to enter a value.
You can use regular number keys or numpad keys.
You lose a life when you make an incorrect entry.
Your streak ends if you run out of lives.
Press ESC for menu, and R to reshuffle the puzzle.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* A pencil mode toggle to allow for testing of numbers.
* A mouse only way to play, with a grid that greys out on completion of number.
* Better end screens. and sounds for losing a life or background music to relax to.
